## implementer/fix-loading-screen — 2026-03-26T01:00:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8
- **Tests run**: no — Docker not available in sandbox; static HTML/JS has no test suite
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-26T01:30:00Z
- **Summary**: Simplified init timeout pattern (replaced fragile Promise.race + sentinel string with a straightforward setTimeout flag), restored missing catch-all for unexpected init errors, and cached overlay title DOM element
- **Tests run**: no — static HTML/JS project has no test suite
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-26T02:00:00Z
- **Summary**: issues found and fixed — race condition where doInit() success path could override timeout error display, and suppressed error logging when timedOut was true
- **quality_checklist**: 5 items verified (q1-q5 all pass after fixes)
- **Fixes applied**:
  - Added `if (state === 'error') return;` guard before success-path UI transition in doInit() to prevent timeout race condition
  - Moved `console.error()` outside the `if (!timedOut)` guard so errors are always logged even after timeout
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true (0 blockers)

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-26T01:08:55Z

- **Conflict**: js/main.js — two conflict regions during rebase onto upstream/main
- **Resolution**:
  - Conflict 1 (variable declarations): merged both sides — kept upstream's `boostIndicator`, `levelEl`, `timerEl` and branch's `retryBtn`
  - Conflict 2 (doInit function body): kept branch's structured error-handling version, removed duplicate upstream init code that was already present above the conflict, added upstream's `calibrate()`, `levelEl`/`timerEl` display, and `gameStartTime` to the success path. Removed references to non-existent `getObstacles`/`getCoins`/`getTurtle` functions that don't exist in upstream's renderer.js
  - Conflict 3 (timeout guard commit): merged upstream's `calibrate()` call with branch's `if (state === 'error') return;` guard
- **Tests run**: none found — static HTML/JS project has no test suite
- **Outcome**: success

## implementer/main — 2026-03-26T02:30:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, q1, q2, q3
- **Tests run**: no — static HTML/JS project has no test suite; verified server serves updated files
- **Outcome**: success — re-implemented all error handling after conflict resolution lost changes

## simplifier — 2026-03-26T03:00:00Z
- **Summary**: Merged showRetryButton() into showError() since every error path always showed the retry button, eliminating 5 duplicate call sites and the standalone function. Removed unused overlayTitle variable.
- **Tests run**: no — static HTML/JS project has no test suite
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-26T03:30:00Z
- **Summary**: issues found and fixed — MediaStream not stopped on error/timeout paths (camera light stays on), init() called without .catch() handler
- **quality_checklist**: 3 items verified (q1-q3 all pass)
- **Fixes applied**:
  - Added `stream.getTracks().forEach(t => t.stop())` in MediaPipe catch block and initTimedOut guard after initTracker
  - Added `.catch()` handler to top-level `init()` call to prevent unhandled promise rejections
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true (0 blockers)
